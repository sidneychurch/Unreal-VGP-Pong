# What Makes _Pong_, _Pong_?
***

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)
>
> Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis.
> The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen.
> They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side.
> Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.
> The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent;
> points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.


When we look at _Pong_, we need to consider what makes _Pong_, _Pong_. Luckily there's not a lot going on.

Things we want to consider:
* Visuals
    * A paddle for each player.
    * A ball.
    * A "net".
    * The score of each player.
* Systems
    * Scoring
    * Player movement
    * Player and ball collision
    * Collisions between the ball and screen boundary.
    * Possible AI for the second player

Let's start by setting up the play area.
